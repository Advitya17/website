  <h4>Bias in OLAP Queries: Detection, Explanation, and Removal </h4>
</div>

### About HypDB

HypDB is the first system to detect, explain, and resolve bias in
decision-support OLAP queries. We show that biased queries can be perplexing
and lead to statistical anomalies, such as Simpson's paradox. We propose
a novel technique to find explanations for the bias, thereby assisting the analyst
in interpreting the results. We develop an automated method for rewriting
the query into an unbiased query that correctly performs the hypothesis test that the analyst had in mind. The rewritten queries compute causal effect or the effect of hypothetical interventions. At the core of our framework lies the
ability to find confounding variables.  HypDB
can be used to detect algorithmic unfairness post factum and the obtained insights
go beyond state of the art e.g., Fairtest.
