  <h1 align="left">The Tukwila Data Integration System</h1>
  <dl>
    <dd>A data integration system is an automated method for querying across 
    multiple heterogeneous databases in a uniform way.&nbsp; In essence, a <em>
    mediated schema</em> is created to represent a particular application domain 
    and data sources are mapped as views over the mediated schema.&nbsp; The user 
    asks a query over the mediated schema and the data integration system 
    reformulates this into a query over the data sources and executes it.&nbsp; The 
    system then intelligently processes the query, reading data across the 
    network and responding to data source sizes, network conditions, and other 
    factors. </dd>

    <dd><br>
    Query processing in data integration occurs over network-bound, autonomous 
    data sources ranging from conventional databases on the LAN or intranet to 
    web-based sources across the Internet.&nbsp; The Tukwila data integration system 
    is designed to scale up to the amounts of data transmissible across 
    intranets and the Internet (tens to hundreds of MBs), with large numbers of 
    data sources.&nbsp; This requires extensions to traditional optimization and 
    execution techniques for three reasons: there is an absence of quality 
    statistics about the data, data transfer rates are unpredictable and bursty, 
    and slow or unavailable data sources can often be replaced by overlapping or 
    mirrored sources.&nbsp; Additionally, the natural data format for data 
    integration is XML -- which creates new challenges in query processing and 
    optimization.&nbsp; (See the discussion of the
    <a target="_self" href="x-scan.html">x-scan</a> operator for more information.) </dd>

    <br>
    <br>
    The Tukwila data integration system can make use of a mediated schema by 
    taking the original query and applying a highly efficient query 
    reformulation algorithm, <a target="_self" href="minicon.html">MiniCon</a>, which maps the input query from the mediated schema to the data 
    sources.&nbsp; Next, the query processing system takes a three-pronged approach 
    to providing efficient query answering:&nbsp; (1) use of operators with <b>
    flexible scheduling</b> policies, to mask latencies, (2) overlapping of 
    query operations using <b>pipelining</b>, even for XML data, with the <i>
    x-scan</i> operator, and (3) <b>convergent query processing</b>, which 
    allows the system to choose a query plan, execute it for some amount of 
    time, then revise statistics and cost estimates and generate an improved 
    plan -- all in mid-stream.&nbsp; Experiments have shown that the Tukwila approach 
    results in superior performance versus traditional techniques. </dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dd>Our architecture extends previous innovations in adaptive execution 
    (such as query scrambling, mid-execution re-optimization, eddies, and choose 
    nodes), and we have experimentally demonstrated the benefits of our system 
    (see the papers below for more information). </dd>
  </dl>
  <h4>Recent Work</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The recent focus of the Tukwila project has been in three areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fully integrated support for efficient processing of XML data, based 
      on the <a target="_self" href="x-scan.html">x-scan</a> operator.&nbsp; XML provides a common encoding for data from many 
      different sources; combined with standardization of schemas (DTDs) across 
      certain domains, it greatly reduces the needs for wrappers and even query 
      reformulation.&nbsp; The latest versions of Tukwila are built around an 
      adaptive query processing architecture for XML, and can seamlessly combine 
      XML and relational data into new XML content. </li>
      <li>Support for output of incremental results in a meaningful fashion.&nbsp; 
      For web-based applications, we would like to see output incrementally, and 
      as early as possible.&nbsp; (This is in contrast to the typical batch-oriented 
      paradigm, in which overall query completion time is key.) </li>
      <li>Providing &quot;preview&quot; answers to queries.&nbsp; In many cases, it may be 
      useful to quickly return some sort of approximate or partial answers 
      during a long-running query, so the user gets early feedback.&nbsp; We have 
      developed a general framework for expressing the semantics of preview 
      results, as well as optimization and execution strategies for &quot;preview 
      queries.&quot;&nbsp; </li>
      <li>Development of techniques and algorithms for &quot;convergent query 
      processing.&quot;&nbsp; Our convergent query processing framework allows the system 
      to continuously re-optimize a query at any point as it gets improved 
      information, for fairly complex classes of queries (including grouping, 
      sorting, etc.). </li>
    </ul>
