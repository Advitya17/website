Exploiting History in Continuous Monitoring Systems</font><br>
---<font face="Arial">MOIRAE</font></h1>
<!-- brief introduction -->
<br>
<br>
<p>Monitoring applications enable users to continuously observe the
current state of a system and receive alerts when interesting events
occur. For example, an administrator can monitor a cluster of
computers, a computer network, the car traffic in some area, etc. In
many situations, historical information about current events may help
users address ongoing or imminent problems in the monitored
system. However, providing timely historical information for real-time
events is challenging because of the large volume of historical data.
</p>
<p>In this project, we are building a new type of continuous
monitoring system called Moirae. The goal of Moirae is to complement
newly detected events with useful historical information in
near-real-time. To achieve this goal, Moirae allows users to describe
what constitutes the interesting context of an event. The system then
delivers, for each new event, a set of k results derived from the most
similar (in terms of given context) recent events.
</p>
<!-- Challenges -->
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p> In the Moirae project, we are addressing the following challenges
related to history-enhanced monitoring.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Context definition and similarity:</b>
    <blockquote>
      <p>When a new event occurs in a monitored system, a large
fraction of
relevant historical information corresponds to those times in the past
when the state of the system was the same or similar to the state at
the time of the event. The first challenge is thus in efficiently
comparing the state of a monitored system at different points in
time. Of course, we want to compare only those parts of the state
which are relevant to the current event (e.g., the list of logged
users and the list of running processes). We call this part of the
state the context of the event.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><b>Approximate k-Nearest Neighbor(k-NN) queries:</b>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Because the historical log is large, the complete set of past
events
related to a current event can be large. To avoid overwhelming the
user, the monitoring system may present only a small set of k most
similar events and their own contexts. These types of queries are
often called k-NN queries. However, unlike previous systems which
define similarity over individual tuples or objects, we expand the
notion of similarity to a set of tuples that constitute an event
context. </p>
      <p>Naive techniques relying on materializing all past events and
their
contexts then scanning these events at runtime to report the most
similar ones do not work well because of the huge volume of historical
data. Users also want the system to behave in real-time so they don't
miss any useful past information when an event occurs. The goal of
Moirae is thus to examine only small parts of history yet return
relevant and useful past information. </p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><b>Performance in face of concurrency:</b>
    <blockquote>
      <p> The system must work well in the presence of multiple
concurrent events. Because continuous queries can produce different
events at different or varying rates, the system is likely to have
multiple concurrent historical queries. These queries compete for
shared resources and the system should be able schedule these queries
and allocate resources properly. </p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>
<!-- System architecture -->
<h2>System Architecture </h2>
<p>
Moirae is a framework which tightly integrates a stream processing engine
(e.g., <a href="http://nms.lcs.mit.edu/projects/borealis/">Borealis</a><a>),
for
continuous monitoring, and an RDBMS, for archiving historical
information.
</a></p>
<p><a>The main insight behind the design of Moirae is that users will
be
more interested in receiving a few relevant results soon after each
new event (especially if these events are recent), rather than a
complete set of results or the best results with higher latency. We
thus proposed a system architecture based on hierarchical log
partitioning and hierarchical query execution, where the recent past
is stored at a higher cost, but can be queried faster than older
data.<br>
