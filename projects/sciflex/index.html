<!--<h1>Nuage - Scientific Data Management in the Cloud</h1> -->
<p>The scientific data management landscape is changing. Improvements
in instrumentation and simulation software are giving scientists access
to data at an unprecedented scale. This data is increasingly being
stored in data centers running thousands of commodity servers. This new
environment creates significant data management challenges. In addition
to efficient query processing, the magnitude of data and queries call
for new query management techniques such as runtime query control and
intra-query fault tolerance.</p>
<p>In this project, we are developing new data management systems and
techniques for enabling scientists to store, analyze, and share large
volumes of data using cloud-computing environments.</p>

<h3>Astronomy Simulation Use-Case and Benchmark</h3>
<p>As one concrete application scenario, we explore the emergent data
management needs of the University of Washington&#8217;s &#8220;N-body Shop&#8221; group,
which specializes in the development and utilization of large-scale
simulations (specifically, &#8220;N-body tree codes&#8221;). These simulations
serve to investigate the formation and evolution of large scale
structure in the universe. The UW N-body Shop is representative of the
current state-of-the-art in astrophysical cosmological simulation. In 2008, the N-body
Shop was the 10th largest consumer of NSF Teragrid time, using 7:5
million CPU hours and generated 50 terabytes of raw data, with an
additional 25 terabytes of post-processing information. The total size
of each simulation ranges in size from 55 GB to a few TB.
We find that the required analysis involves three types of tasks:
filtering and correlating the data at different times in the
simulation, clustering data within one simulated timestep, and querying
the clustered data.
We are in the process of developing a benchmark comprising all three
types of tasks. The publication below presents the first part of the
benchmark along with some preliminary results from running this
benchmakrk on Pig/Hadoop and a commercial relational database management
system. The following sub-project discusses clustering. We did not yet
address the challenge of querying clustered data.

<h3>Efficient Clustering Algorithms for Shared-Nothing Systems </h3>In
this project, we focus on one common yet challenging data analysis
problem from the astronomy simulation domain: massive-scale data
clustering. We study the performance and scalability of a clustering
algorithm called Friends-of-Friends. This algorithm is designed to
cluster points in a multi-dimensional space and is commonly used on
simulation data to study galaxy formation and evolution.

<h3>The Parallax Time-based Progress Indicator for Parallel Queries </h3>
<p>In parallel query-processing environments, accurate, time-oriented
progress indicators could provide much utility to users given that
queries take a very long time to complete and both inter- and
intra-query execution times can have high variance. In these systems,
query times depend on the query plans and the amount of data being
processed, but also on the amount of parallelism available, the types
of operators (often user-defined) that perform the processing, and the
overall system load. None of the techniques used by existing tools or
available in the literature provide a non-trivial progress indicator
for parallel queries. In this project, we are building Parallax, an
accurate, time-oriented progress indicator for parallel queries. </p>
