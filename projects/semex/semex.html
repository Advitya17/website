<p>Personal information management (PIM) is a subject of growing interest to the
<span class="hl">data</span> management community. We are building the Semex 
System that offers users a flexible platform for personal information 
management. First, Semex organizes <span class="hl">data</span> in a 
semantically meaningful way by providing a domain model consisting of classes 
and associations between the classes. Second, Semex leverages the PIM 
environment to support on-the-fly integration of personal <span class="hl">data</span> 
and public <span class="hl">data</span>. Based on the logical view of personal 
information, we allow the user to browse information by association and we 
pursue enriched searching experiences. (See overview papers [1,2] and demo [3])</p>

  <li><b>Reference Reconciliation</b> </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>Since the <span class="hl">data</span> we manage in PIM is very 
  heterogeneous and we need to support multiple sources of associations, it is 
  crucial that the <span class="hl">data</span> instances mesh together 
  seamlessly. To truly follow the chains of associations and find all the 
  information about a particular individual (or publication, conference, etc.), 
  Semex needs to be able to reconcile the many references to the same real-world 
  object.</p>
  <p>Reference reconciliation in PIM has three challenges: First, the domain 
  model consists multiple classes and we need to reconcile references of 
  multiple classes. Considering each class separately will miss the rich 
  information hidden behind across-class associations. Second, each extracted 
  instance contains very limited information, i.e., contains values for only a 
  few atomic attributes. Third, some attributes are multi-valued, so the fact 
  that two attribute values are different does not imply that the two references 
  refer to different real-world objects.</p>
  <p>Our intuition is to exploit the rich information hidden behind the 
  object-association network. We propose using context information, similarities 
  computed on related entities, and enriched references during reconciliation.

  <li><b>Indexing</b></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
	<p>In a personal information management system, it is important that users 
	are able to specify varying degrees of structure in their queries, and are 
	able to compose queries that contain keywords and that are structure-aware 
	(e.g., “a Paper with title ‘SEMEX’ authored by ‘Dong’ and published in ‘CIDR 
	2005’ ”). To efficiently answer such queries, we designed a generic index 
	for loosely-coupled heterogeneous data. (See paper [7].) </p>
	<p>The index extends the traditional inverted list by capturing not only 
	text values, but also structural information when it is present, including 
	attributes of instances, associations between instances, synonyms on schema 
	elements, and hierarchies of schema elements. This index not only speeds up 
	answering queries that combine keywords and structural information, but also 
	improves keyword search by returning implicitly relevant objects, which are 
	associated with objects that explicitly contain the keywords in attribute 
	values.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li><b>Answering structured queries on unstructured data</b></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>SEMEX manages both structured data (extracted instances and associations) 
	and unstructured data (files that contain rich text, such as Word documents 
	and webpages). The goal of SEMEX is to provide a uniform interface for users 
	to query the information on one's desktop, regardless of their formats. 
	Querying structured and unstructured data in isolation has been the main 
	subject of research for the fields of Databases and Information Retrieval. 
	Recently the Database Community has studied the problem of answering keyword 
	queries on structured data such as relational data or XML data. The only 
	combination that has not been fully explored is answering structured queries 
	on unstructured data. </p>
	<p>Traditional approaches solve this problem by first extracting structure 
	from the text. We instead proposed constructing a keyword query from a given 
	structured query, and submitting the query to the search engine for 
	retrieving unstructured data (see paper [6]). The key of the solution is to 
	model a query as a graph of objects and associations, and then select the 
	node and edge labels that best summarize the graph.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Domain Model Personalization</b> </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>Semex comes with a generic domain model (see an
  <a href="./domainModel.gif" target="main">
  example</a>) and offers several ways of manually personalizing it. For 
  example, Semex users can extend their domain model by example. The browsing 
  pattern can, in itself, already define a new class or association in the 
  domain model. Alternatively, the user may refine, modify or generalize the 
  pattern or combine it with other patterns to create the desired class. 
  Ultimately, we would like the system to identify interesting clusters of 
  information, and propose extensions based on them.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>One specific problem in domain model personalization is that sometimes a 
  precise domain model does not exist, either because we don't know what it is 
  or because one does not exist. Also, we may prefer not to model the domain in 
  such level of detail because an overly complex model may be a burden on 
  personal users. To address these needs, we propose the concept of <i>malleable 
  schemas</i> as a modeling tool that enables us to capture the important 
  aspects of the domain at modeling time without having to commit to a very 
  strict schema. (See paper [5].)</p>
