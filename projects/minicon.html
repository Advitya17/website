<h4>Query Reformulation Overview</h4>
<dl>
  <dd>A data integration system provides a uniform method for querying across 
  multiple heterogeneous databases.&nbsp; It presents a <em>mediated schema</em> to 
  represent a particular application domain, and data sources are mapped as 
  views over this mediated schema.&nbsp; The user asks a query over the mediated 
  schema and the data integration system reformulates this into a query over the 
  data sources and executes it.&nbsp; The process of &nbsp;translating the user query into 
  a query over the data systems is the process of query reformulation, which is 
  the problem that MiniCon solves. </dd>

  <dt><strong>Query Reformulating Challenges</strong> </dt>
  <dd>&nbsp; </dd>
  <dd>In the data integration system, there can by hundreds or thousands of data 
  sources.&nbsp; These sources may be added or removed from the system at any time.&nbsp; 
  Thus, there are two main challenges to query reformulation: first, we must 
  insure that user queries can be answered in a short amount of time.&nbsp; Second, 
  we must enable sources to be added and deleted with the least amount of human 
  intervention.&nbsp; Representing the data sources as views over the mediated schema 
  enables new data sources to be added with a minimum of human intervention, but 
  the problem of translating the query into queries over the data sources (query 
  reformulation) is NP-Complete for even conjunctive queries.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our goal in this 
  project was to find a scalable algorithm for query reformulation (which is 
  equivalent to the problem of answering queries using views) and to show 
  experimentally that these algorithms were feasible for even a large number of 
  data sources. </dd>
