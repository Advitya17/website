<!-- brief introduction -->

<br><br>

<p>Today's users acquire and produce large volumes of digital data: digital pictures, music files, home videos, documents. Users need tools to help them organize and manage this information. In this project, we are exploring techniques to help users organize their data in flexible ways, protect their data, but also selectively share their data with other users on the Internet. In particular, we are building a prototype system called HomeViews that allows users to: 
<ul>
  <li>Create database-style views over their file repositories</li>
  <li>Selectively grant (and later revoke) access to their views to other remote users</li>
  <li>Create and share views that are defined over their local files, local views,<em> and views imported from other users</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>HomeViews enables all the above features without requiring any
account management nor user authentication thus minimizing the
administrative burden on the users. 

<p>HomeViews' protection mechanism is based on capabilities.
Originally developed in the context of object-based operating systems,
a capability bundles together a view name with access rights.  Users
give each other access to their data simply by exchanging capabilities
to their views, much like users enable each other to view their
private Web pages by exchanging URLs.

<h2>System Architecture </h2>

<p align="left">The figure below shows the high-level architecture of
HomeViews.

<p>At the lowest level, all files are stored in the file system as
usual. They can also be edited directly by accessing the file
system. HomeViews is a middleware that sits between applications and
a desktop search engine such as <a
href="http://beagle-project.org/Main_Page">Beagle</a> or <a
href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight/">Mac OS
Spotlight</a>. Users interact with applications built on top of
HomeViews. Applications translate user actions into requests to our
engine. Users can create views, modify views, create capabilities for
views, share these capabilities, compose views, and execute queries
over both local and remote views. HomeViews keeps track of all
locally-created views and capabilities in its internal catalog. It
also manages the potentially distributed query execution resulting
from evaluating queries over views.
