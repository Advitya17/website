## <a name="Overview" id="Overview"></a>Overview

Astronomy has long been a data-intensive science. Today, the need to analyze massive amounts of data streaming from telescopes and generated by  simulations is more pressing than ever.

 AstroDB  is an inter-disciplinary group bringing together faculty from the department of [Astronomy](http://www.astro.washington.edu/) (in particular the [Survey Science Group](http://ssg.astro.washington.edu/home_ssg.shtml) and the [N-body Shop](http://www-hpcc.astro.washington.edu/)), department of [Computer Science &amp; Engineering](http://www.cs.washington.edu/) (in particular the [Database Group](http://db.cs.washington.edu)), and the UW [eScience Instititute](http://escience.washington.edu/) to investigate new methods, tools, and techniques for data-driven discovery in Astronomy.

We are tackling several inter-related challenges:

&nbsp;


### Efficient Processing of Telescope Images

A core component of Astronomy research revolves around the efficient processing of images produced by various telescopes, in particular various sky surveys such as the [SDSS](http://www.sdss.org/) and the  [LSST](http://www.lsst.org/lsst/).

Our group is working on various novel methods and tools for processing these images and making their analysis not only faster but also more convenient.

Make sure to visit the [UW Survey Science Group (LSST)](http://ssg.astro.washington.edu/lsst.shtml?lsst/dm) page for background and important details.

*   <p class="style6">In the context of the AstroDB collaboration, we have worked on image co-addition methods using Hadoop. The results of this work are summarized in the following publication: 

    **[Astronomy in the Cloud: Using MapReduce for Image Co-Addition](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/%7Emagda/papers/wiley11.pdf)**., Wiley, K., Connolly, A., Gardner, J., Krughoff, S., Balazinska, M., Howe, B., Kwon, Y., Bu, Y., Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (PASP),  Vol. 123, No. 901, pp. 366-380, University of Chicago Press, Mar 2011.

*   <p class="style6">We are now working on various image co-addition and full image analysis pipelines using SciDB. This work is related to our efforts bulding the SciDB parallel data processing system. See the [main SciDB page](http://scidb.org) and our [UW CSE SciDB page](http://scidb.cs.washington.edu).

*   We are also working on exploring and analyzing sources extracted from telescope images using parallel database management systems including EMC/Greenplum. This work includes leveraging various machine-learning methods to improve the efficiency of the analysis.

*   SDSS image data is available through a Web-based SQL interface. We used logs from this website to evaluate new techniques that help author SQL queries in the context of Big Data analytics.

### Generating Simulated LSST Images from SQL Server Catalogs

In order to test the various LSST image processing pipelines, the UW Astronomy group has built a system for generating realistic LSST images. As part of the AstroDB collaboration, we studied how best to leverage a relational database system such as SQL Server in order to store the catalog data and query it efficiently as part of this image generation process.

### Analyzing Astronomy Simulation Data

We have explored the use of relational database management systems both single-node and parallel and also the use of new MapReduce-type systems for the analysis of data generated by N-body simulations. 

Make sure to visit the [N-Body Shop](http://www-hpcc.astro.washington.edu/) for
important details and background information.

<p class="style6">The details of the specific project done by the AstroDB collaboration are described on our [Nuage project website](http://nuage.cs.washington.edu). We summarize the key aspects of the project here:

*   Basic use-case studying the potential of relational database systems and MapReduce systems for simulation data analysis. The results of the use-case are summarized in the following publication. The data used in the use-case is also available on the Nuage website:

    **[Analyzing Massive Astrophysical Datasets: Can Pig/Hadoop or a Relational DBMS Help?](http://nuage.cs.washington.edu/pubs/iasds09.pdf)**. Sarah Loebman, Dylan Nunley, YongChul Kwon, Bill Howe, Magdalena Balazinska, and Jeffrey P. Gardner. In the Workshop on Interfaces and Abstractions for Scientific Data (IASDS) 2009, New Orleans, LA, August 2009.

*   We also worked on more advanced analytics requiring data clustering:

    **[Scalable clustering algorithm for N-body simulations in a shared-nothing cluster](http://nuage.cs.washington.edu/pubs/ssdbm10.pdf)**. YongChul Kwon, Dylan Nunley, Jeffrey P. Gardner, Magdalena Balazinska, Bill Howe, and Sarah Loebman. In the 22nd International Conference on Scientific and Statistical  Database Management (SSDBM), Heidelberg, Germany, July, 2010.

*   We developed new tools and techniques inspired by the astronomy simulation data analysis needs:
