<h1 class="Body" align="left">X-Scan: a Foundation for XML Data Integration</h1>
<dl>
  <dd>The adoption of XML promises to accelerate construction of systems that 
  integrate distributed, heterogeneous data. Query languages for XML are 
  typically based on <em>regular path expressions</em> that traverse the logical 
  XML graph structure; the efficient evaluation of such path expressions is 
  central to good query processing performance. Most existing XML query 
  processing systems convert XML documents to an internal representation, 
  generally a set of tables or objects; path expressions are evaluated using 
  either index structures or join operations across the tables or objects. 
  Unfortunately, the required index creation or join operations are often costly 
  even with locally stored data, and they are especially expensive in the data 
  integration domain, where the system reads data streamed from remote sources 
  across a network, and seldom reuses results for subsequent queries.<p>We 
  propose the <em>x-scan</em> operator, which efficiently processes 
  non-materialized XML data as it is being received by the data integration 
  system. X-scan matches regular path expression patterns from the query, 
  returning results in pipelined fashion as the data streams across the network. 
  Building from x-scan, we have constructed a new version of the
  <a target="_self" href="tukwila.html">Tukwila Data Integration System</a> that efficiently integrates streaming XML 
  and relational data, combining the results seamlessly into new XML content.</dd>
</dl>
<h4 class="Body">Background</h4>
<dl>
  <dd>The eXtensible Markup Language provides a common format for data across 
  the network, and is being supported by nearly every data management tool. XML 
  is based on nested open- and close-tags, or elements, that may have 
  attributes. XML can be represented as a graph, as is shown below with a sample 
  XML document and its equivalent data graph.<p>
  <img src="images/XML.GIF" border="0" width="597" height="527"><br>
  <br>
  <img alt="Sample XML data graph" src="images/xmlgraph.gif" align="middle" border="0" width="805" height="400">
  </p>
  <p>We query XML data by selecting nodes from the graph through regular path 
  expressions, and then manipulate those nodes. The query below, written in the
  <a href="http://www.research.att.com/~mff/xmlql/">
  XML-QL</a> language, finds and returns all lab names and cities.</p>
  <p><strong><font face="Courier New,Courier" size="3">WHERE &lt;db&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;lab&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;name&gt;$n&lt;/&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;_*&gt;&lt;city&gt;$c&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/&gt; ELEMENT_AS $l<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/&gt; IN &quot;fig1.xml&quot;</font><font face="Courier New,Courier" size="2"><br>
  ...</font></strong> </p>
  <p>which can be expressed equivalently as a combination of 3 regular path 
  expressions (with the latter two dependent on the first):</p>

  <p>and which selects the following nodes in the graph:</p>
  <p>
  <img alt="Graph with query nodes highlighted" src="images/query-graph.gif" border="0" width="805" height="400">
  </dd>
</dl>
<h4 class="Body">Challenges</h4>
<dl>
  <dd>To date, most efforts to build XML query processors, and to evaluate 
  regular path expressions, have been based on first loading the data into a 
  local repository, building indexes on the repository, and then processing the 
  query. The approaches differ on whether the repository is a relational 
  database, an object-oriented database or a repository for semi-structured 
  data.<p>In many applications involving XML, however, we must be able to 
  process queries over streams of incoming XML data, without having the luxury 
  of first loading the data into a local repository. In particular, data 
  integration applications often involve processing data over sources on a 
  wide-area network whose contents change continuously, and hence storing the 
  data locally is not a viable approach. Furthermore, it is imperative that we 
  produce results incrementally as the data streams into the system, since 
  queries are usually ad-hoc and interactive.</dd>
</dl>
<h4 class="Body">The x-scan solution</h4>
<dl>
  <dd>X-scan is a new method for evaluating path expressions as data is 
  streaming into the system. The input to x-scan is an XML data stream and a set 
  of regular path expressions occurring in a query; x-scan's output is a stream 
  of bindings for the variables occuring in the expressions. A key feature of 
  x-scan is that it produces these bindings incrementally, as the XML data is 
  streaming in; hence, x-scan fits naturally as the source operator to a complex 
  pipeline, and it is highly suited for data integration applications.<p>X-scan 
  is motivated by the observation that IDREF links are limited to the scope of 
  the current document, so in principle, the entire XML query graph for a 
  document could be constructed in a single pass. X-scan achieves this by 
  simultaneously parsing the XML data, indexing nodes by their IDs, resolving 
  IDREFs, and returning the nodes that match the path expressions of the query. 
  The path expression matching algorithm is based on finite state machines, as 
  shown below. </p>
  <p>
  <img src="images/fsms.gif" width="623" height="148">
  </p>
  <p>The machines are run during XML document parsing.</p>
  <p>In addition to the path expression evaluation routines, x-scan includes the 
  following functionality:</p>
  <p>Parsing the XML document:<br>
  X-scan uses the IBM XML4C parser</p>
  <p>Node ID recording and reference resolving: <br>
  - XML elements may have ID attributes <br>
  - Other elements can reference these <br>
  - X-scan resolves all references during parsing </p>
  <p>Creating a graph-structured index of the file: <br>
  - XML maps to a graph, but is stored as a tree <br>
  - X-scan builds an index of the links in the graph </p>
  <p>Returning tuples of node locations: <br>
  - The output of x-scan is in the form of tuples <br>
  - In our example, we have (l, n, c) tuples for each applicable combination of 
  lab, name, and city <br>
  - These tuples are used to construct query results</dd>
