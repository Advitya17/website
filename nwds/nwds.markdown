# Northwest Database Society (NWDB)
####_Sponsored by Yahoo!_

## Mission Statement
The goal of NWDS is to bring together researchers and practitioners in the field of databases and data management systems working in the Pacific North-West.

One of our main activities is a talk series with a variety of distinguished speakers from academia and industry. These talks are also part of the **Yahoo! Database Talk Series** (sponsored by Yahoo!). This quarter's talks are organized by [Alvin](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/akcheung/).

##  Upcoming Talks 

**Speaker**: [Daniel von Dincklage](http://research.google.com/pubs/author36313.html), Google

**Title**: Yedalog: Exploring Knowledge at Scale

**Where**: University of Washington, Seattle.  
Computer Science and Engineering Department.  
[Electrical Engineering Building](http://uw.edu/maps/?ee1), Room 037.

**When**: Friday, October 9th, 2015, 2:30pm - 3:20pm.

**Abstract**:  
With modern data processing frameworks, programmers are often the
bottleneck when analyzing large repositories of data. We introduce
Yedalog, a declarative programming
language that allows programmers to mix data-parallel pipelines and
computation seamlessly in a single language. Most existing tools for
data-parallel computation embed a sublanguage
of data-parallel pipelines in a general-purpose language, or vice versa.
Yedalog extends
Datalog, incorporating not only computational features from logic
programming, but also features for working with data structured as
nested records. Yedalog programs can run both on a single machine, and
distributed across a cluster in batch and interactive modes, allowing
programmers to mix different modes of execution easily.

**Bio**:
Daniel von Dincklage is Tech Lead for the Yedalog project. He went to the Technische Universtiaet Darmstadt in Germany and got his PhD from University of Colorado at Boulder. His main research interest is the interaction of static software analyses with programmer productivity tools.

**Speaker**: [Sailesh Krishnamurthy](http://sites.google.com/site/sailesh/), Amazon

**Title**: An Introduction to Amazon Aurora

**Where**: University of Washington, Seattle.  
Computer Science and Engineering Department.  
Paul Allen Center, Database Lab, CSE 405.  

**When**: Friday, November 13th, 2015, 2:30pm - 3:20pm.

**Abstract**:  

In this talk I will provide an architectural overview of Amazon
Aurora, a new cloud-native relational database engine that combines
the speed and reliability of high-end commercial databases with the
simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open source databases.

Aurora delivers up to five times the throughput of standard MySQL
running on the same hardware. Aurora is delivered as a managed service
(via Amazon RDS) that handles time-consuming tasks such as
provisioning, patching, backup, recovery, failure detection, and
repair. Aurora increases MySQL performance and availability by tightly
integrating the database engine with an SSD-backed virtualized storage
layer purpose-built for database workloads.  Aurora's storage is
fault-tolerant and self-healing. Disk failures are repaired in the
background without loss of database availability. Aurora is designed
to automatically detect database crashes and restart without the need
for crash recovery or to rebuild the database cache. In addition,
Aurora will also automatically failover to one of up to 15 read
replicas.

**Bio**:

Sailesh Krishnamurthy is a Senior Engineering Manager at Amazon Web
Services (AWS) where he leads engineering for the Amazon Aurora
database kernel. Prior to AWS, Sailesh was at Cisco Systems via the
acquisition of Truviso, a real-time streaming data analytics software
company that he co-founded to commercialize his prior academic
research.  At Truviso, he built and managed the initial engineering,
services and support teams and was also the original developer of the
core platform. Sailesh is an authority in the field of data management
with over a dozen published academic papers and several issued
U.S. patents. He investigated the technical ideas at the heart of
Truviso¹s products as part of his doctoral research on stream query
processing, earning a Ph.D. in Computer Science from UC Berkeley in
2006. Prior to graduate work at Berkeley he worked at IBM on core
database products and at Netscape on a Java virtual machine
implementation. Sailesh has a Master¹s degree in Computer Science from
Purdue University and a Bachelor¹s degree in Electrical Engineering
from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India.
